Welcome to the documentation for MacroPlus! Here you'll find information on how to get started with MacroPlus, how to use its more advanced features, and documentation for the code itself.

## What is MacroPlus?
---
I'm so glad you asked! MacroPlus is an application that adds much-needed logic functionality to Eos Family lighting consoles. If you've ever wondered why Eos doesn't have an easy way to insert show data into macros, or if you've ever wanted to run cleanup macros automatically while programming, MacroPlus can do that!

### Functions and Features
- Custom macros and logic integrating smoothly with Eos
- Auto-triggering events
- Simple scripting offering deep programming possibilities
- A handy web interface to run macros manually, and to keep an eye on persistent data

## How do I get started?

## Frequently Asked Questions
---
### Why use MacroPlus instead of Eos' built-in features?
MacroPlus isn't meant to *replace* Eos macros, nor should it be used to. Instead, think of it as a way to fill in gaps in the Eos macro system. Eos' macro system is well-crafted by ETC, and it runs without any additional user setup. And while getting MacroPlus up and running couldn't be easier, it adds additional complexity to a show system. Rather than being a show-critical piece of software, MacroPlus is best viewed as a programming tool (though that might change in the future!).

### What sorts of productions is MacroPlus meant for?
MacroPlus is great for any scale, style, or level of production! MacroPlus was created because I found myself working in so many different systems it became hard to keep track of what each space could do, and what I had to change in my setup to accommodate it. Rather than force everywhere I worked to change, I decided to make a tool to make it easier for myself and others to adapt to the space without losing valuable time.

### Do I need programming knowledge to use MacroPlus?
No! MacroPlus is intended to be accessible to everyone, regardless of skill or computer experience. Its scripting language is simple and clear, meaning you can learn it and get your macros built in minutes, not days.

### Is MacroPlus free?
Yes, *and it always will be.* I believe that whenever I build something for myself, others could probably benefit from it too. As a result, everything I make goes up for free, forever. If you plan to use MacroPlus' source code in a way that earns you or a company money, please reach out! But whether you're an individual in your home or a multi-million dollar production, MacroPlus is yours to use.
