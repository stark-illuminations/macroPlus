# MacroPlus
---
MacroPlus is a Python-based plugin for ETC's Eos series of consoles, allowing users to expand macro capabilities for better programming speed and more functional macros.

MacroPlus allows users to write custom scripts which can be triggered by any OSC command. These scripts can fetch information from the console, set internal variables, output OSC, and more. The scripting system uses a custom framework with easy-to-understand patterns so new scripts can be written simply and quickly.

While it is in early alpha, MacroPlus currently makes a great programming tool! It's not quite ready for show-critical applications, but it might be someday!

# Installation
---
Since MacroPlus is still in early alpha, installation requires some mild technical knowledge. As the documentation is a work in progress, installation instructions currently boil down to:
- Clone this repository
- Install dependencies
- Run osc_server.py and app.py
